<p>The <strong>18th International Symposium on Database Programming Languages
(DBPL 2020)</strong> will be held in conjunction with VLDB 2020
on September 4th, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan.</p>

<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>

<p>The <strong>DBPL</strong> symposium is aimed at improving understanding,
and facilitating exchange of ideas, between data management
and programming languages research, broadly construed.
For over 30 years, <strong>DBPL</strong> has established itself as the principal
venue for publishing and discussing new ideas at the
intersection of databases and programming languages.
Many key contributions in query languages for object-oriented data,
persistent databases, nested relational data, semistructured data,
as well as fundamental ideas in types for query languages were
first announced at <strong>DBPL</strong>.</p>

<p>As an established destination for such new ideas,
<strong>DBPL</strong> aims to solicit submissions from researchers in databases,
programming languages or any other community interested in the design,
implementation or foundations of languages and systems
for data-centric computation.
Our main goal is to provide an inter-disciplinary venue
where current trends, open problems,
as well as insights about research methodology
for potential solutions can be shared and discussed
between the two communities.</p>
