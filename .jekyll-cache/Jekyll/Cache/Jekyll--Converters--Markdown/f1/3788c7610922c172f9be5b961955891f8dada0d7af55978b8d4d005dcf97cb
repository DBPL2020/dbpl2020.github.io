<p>The <strong>16<sup>th</sup> International Symposium on Database Programming Languages (DBPL 2017)</strong> will be held in conjunction with VLDB 2017 on September 1st, 2017 in Munich, Germany.</p>

<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>

<p><strong>DBPL</strong> is a biennial symposium that aims to foster exchange of ideas and discussion about current trends and open problems between the data management and the programming languages research communities. For over 30 years, <strong>DBPL</strong> has established itself as the principal venue for publishing and discussing new ideas and problems at the intersection of data management and programming languages. Many key contributions relevant to the formal foundations, design, implementation, and evaluation of query languages (e.g., for object-oriented, nested, or semi-structured data) were first announced at <strong>DBPL</strong>.</p>

<p>As an established destination for such new ideas, <strong>DBPL</strong> aims to solicit submissions from researchers in databases, programming languages or any other community interested in the design, implementation or foundations of languages and systems for data-centric computation. Our main goal is to provide an inter-disciplinary venue where current trends, open problems, as well as insights about research methodology for potential solutions can be shared and discussed between the two communities.</p>
