<p>The <strong>18th International Symposium on Database Programming Languages
(DBPL 2020)</strong> will be held in conjunction with VLDB 2020
on September 4th, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan.</p>

<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>

<p>The DBPL symposium is aimed at improving understanding,
and facilitating exchange of ideas, between data management
and programming languages research, broadly construed.
For over 30 years, DBPL has established itself as the principal
venue for publishing and discussing new ideas at the
intersection of databases and programming languages.
Many key contributions in query languages for object-oriented data,
persistent databases, nested relational data, semistructured data,
as well as fundamental ideas in types for query languages were
first announced at DBPL.
Today, ideas from programming languages play an important role in a range of
advanced applications of databases, streaming computation,
high-performance (GPU/multicore) computation, and security.
This creative research area is broadening into a subfield
of data-centric computation, with recent workshops held
with a range of venues. DBPL is an established destination
for such new ideas and solicits submissions from researchers
in databases, programming languages or any other community
interested in the design, implementation or foundations
of data-centric computation.</p>

<p><strong>DBPL</strong> is a biennial symposium that aims to foster exchange of ideas and discussion about current trends and open problems between the data management and the programming languages research communities. For over 30 years, <strong>DBPL</strong> has established itself as the principal venue for publishing and discussing new ideas and problems at the intersection of data management and programming languages. Many key contributions relevant to the formal foundations, design, implementation, and evaluation of query languages (e.g., for object-oriented, nested, or semi-structured data) were first announced at <strong>DBPL</strong>.</p>

<p>As an established destination for such new ideas, <strong>DBPL</strong> aims to solicit submissions from researchers in databases, programming languages or any other community interested in the design, implementation or foundations of languages and systems for data-centric computation. Our main goal is to provide an inter-disciplinary venue where current trends, open problems, as well as insights about research methodology for potential solutions can be shared and discussed between the two communities.</p>
