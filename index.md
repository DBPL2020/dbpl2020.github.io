## General Information

The **DBPL** symposium is aimed at improving understanding,
and facilitating exchange of ideas, between data management
and programming languages research, broadly construed.

For over 30 years, **DBPL** has established itself as the principal venue
for publishing and discussing new ideas and problems
at the intersection of data management and programming languages.
Many key contributions relevant to the formal foundations, design,
implementation, and evaluation of query languages
(e.g., for object-oriented, nested,
or semi-structured data) were first announced at **DBPL**.

**DBPL 2020** solicits theoretical and practical papers in all areas of
*Data-Centric Programming Languages*.
Please see the [Call for Papers](call_for_papers.html)
for more detailed information.
