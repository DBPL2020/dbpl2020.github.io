## Call for Papers

The **18th International Symposium on Database Programming Languages
(DBPL 2020)** will be held in conjunction with VLDB 2020
on September 4th, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan.

For over 30 years, DBPL has established itself as the principal venue
for publishing and discussing new ideas at the intersection of broadly
understood databases and programming languages. Many key contributions
in query languages for object-oriented data, persistent databases,
nested relational data, and semistructured data, as well as
fundamental ideas in types for query languages, were first announced
at DBPL. Today, this creative research area is broadening into a
subfield of data-centric computation, currently scattered among a
range of venues. DBPL is an established destination for such new ideas
and solicits submissions from researchers in databases, programming
languages or any other community interested in the design,
implementation or foundations of data-centric computation.

### Scope and Topics

Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest for submissions include:

- Language-Integrated Query Mechanisms
- Emerging and Nontraditional Data Models
- Compiling Query Languages to Modern Hardware
- Data-Centric Programming Abstractions, Comprehensions, Monads
- Data Integration, Exchange, and Interoperability
- Data Synchronization and Bidirectional Transformations
- Declarative Data Centers (e.g., distributed query processing, serverless
  computing platforms, social computing platforms, etc)
- Language-Based Security in Data Management
- Managing Uncertain and Imprecise Information
- Metaprogramming and Heterogeneous Staged Computation
- Programming Language Support for Data-Centric Programming (e.g., databases,
  web programming, machine learning, etc)
- Query Compilation and In-memory Databases
- Query Language Design and Implementation
- Query Transformation and Optimization
- Schema Mapping and Metadata Management
- Semantics and Verification of Database Systems
- Stream Data Processing and Query Languages
- Type and Effect Systems for Data-Centric Programming

### Submissions

We invite submissions in two categories: full and short papers.
Submissions in either category must be written in English and
submitted, by the submission deadline, as PDF files formatted
according to the EPTCS style.
See [http://info.eptcs.org/](http://info.eptcs.org/).

**Full papers** are expected to present original research or
development. They should be no more than 12 pages long, excluding
references. Each submission should begin with a succinct statement of
the problem and the summary of main results. Authors may provide
more details to substantiate claims of the paper by including
a clearly marked appendix at the end of the submission, which is not
included in the page limit and is read at the discretion of the
committee.

**Short papers** of at most 6 pages may describe work in progress,
demos, research challenges or visions. Accepted short papers may be
excluded from the formal proceedings at authors' request.

Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere.  Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted.

**Submission site**: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dbpl2020](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dbpl2020)

Review is single-blind, so authors do not need to anonymize their submissions.
PC submissions are allowed, except for the co-chairs.
