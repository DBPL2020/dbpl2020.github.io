## Call for Papers

The **18th International Symposium on Database Programming Languages
(DBPL 2020)** will be held in conjunction with VLDB 2020
on September 4th, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan.

## General Information

The **DBPL** symposium is aimed at improving understanding,
and facilitating exchange of ideas, between data management
and programming languages research, broadly construed.
For over 30 years, **DBPL** has established itself as the principal
venue for publishing and discussing new ideas at the
intersection of databases and programming languages.
Many key contributions in query languages for object-oriented data,
persistent databases, nested relational data, semistructured data,
as well as fundamental ideas in types for query languages were
first announced at **DBPL**.

As an established destination for such new ideas,
**DBPL** aims to solicit submissions from researchers in databases,
programming languages or any other community interested in the design,
implementation or foundations of languages and systems
for data-centric computation.
Our main goal is to provide an inter-disciplinary venue
where current trends, open problems,
as well as insights about research methodology
for potential solutions can be shared and discussed
between the two communities.
